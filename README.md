An Introduction
===============

This template is designed to make homework assignments written in LaTeX easy and elegant looking, and is what I use for most of my assignments. 
This package provides all of the necessary components to use this template. For contributions, comments, and bug reports, please contact me (my email can be found at [my website](http://www.jaysayre.com)).
This homework template is based on the latex template by [Ted Pavlic](http://www.tedpavlic.com/post_homework_tex_example.php). 

Table of Contents
=================

If you have an assignment long enough to warrant a table of contents, a TOC can be easily added.
This is done by editing the homework.tex file and uncommenting these three lines:

```
\newpage
\tableofcontents 
\newpage
```
