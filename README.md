An Introduction
===============

This template is designed to make any latex homework assignment easy and nice looking, and is what I use for most of my assignments.
This package provides all of the necessary components to use this template. For contributions, comments, and bug reports, please contact Jay Sayre at jsayre at marlboro edu.
This homework template is based on the latex template by [Ted Pavlic](http://www.tedpavlic.com/post_homework_tex_example.php). 

Table of Contents
=================

If you have an assignment long enough to warrant a table of contents then you can add one.
This is done by editing the homework.cls file, and uncommenting the last three lines or copy and pasting:

```
\newpage
\tableofcontents 
\newpage
```
